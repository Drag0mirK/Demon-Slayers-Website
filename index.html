                                Tanjiro Kamado became a Demon Slayer to hunt down the demon who murdered his family and turned his sister into a demon. A rarity among the other Slayers, Tanjiro empathizes with his demon enemies. He always kills them, but understands that most demons had no choice when they were transformed.

                                    Gyomei Himejima is the Stone Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps. Instead of the typical Nichirin Blades that Demon Slayers use, Gyomei wields a devastatingly strong hand-ax with a spiked flail attached to the hilt by a long chain.

                                    Sanemi is very hot-headed and harbors a deep hatred for demons, but it's understandable given how many people he's lost over the years. Sanemi's body is also covered in scars accumulated over his many years of slaying demons.

                                    Giyu Tomioka was the first Demon Slayer Tanjiro ever met. After witnessing a newly transformed Nezuko protect Tanjiro, Tomioka points them to Urokodaki and the Demon Slayer Corps. Tomioka may not be the best with social interactions, but his fellow Hashira recognize him as one of the strongest in the group.

                                    Mitsuri Kanroji is the Love Hashira of the Demon Slayer Corps. She is shy, gentle, bubbly, and has eight times the muscle density of an average human, making her wickedly strong despite her thin limbs. Her strength is so incredible that she can withstand attacks that would tear the average human body apart.

                                    While Shinobu is regarded as the weakest Hashira, Obanai is known as the second-weakest. Unlike Shinobu, who never activated her Demon Slayer mark, Obanai could activate his. This allowed him to fight at peak performance, even when he lost his vision.

                                    Kokushibo is part of the Twelve Demon Moons and has the rank of Upper Moon One - the strongest of all of the Moons in the Kimetsu no Yaiba series. Before becoming a Demon, he was called Michikatsu Tsugikuni and was part of the Demon Slayer Corps.He is the crator of Moon Breathing.

                                Doma's origin story is shrouded in mystery, but we do know that he was turned into a demon by Muzan over a century before the events of the anime series began. Initially an Upper Moon Six, Doma was later promoted to Upper Moon Two for reasons unknown. With his War Fans and powerful Cryokinesis Blood Art, Doma is a formidable foe capable of taking down even the toughest of Hashira.

                                Akaza is a stubborn demon who respects the strong and despises the weak. So much so that the demon goes out of his way to challenge powerful fighters and demon slayers. Whenever Akaza would face off against opponents he deemed worthy, he would ask for their names and even introduce himself as a form of respect. He remembers the name of every opponent he has fought against throughout his life as a demon.

                                Hantengu is one of the demons in the Demon Slayer: Swordsmith Village Arc. He is also the Upper Rank Four Demon Moon of the Twelve Kizuki, serving and reporting directly to Muzan Kibutsuji. Though always appearing weak and scared out of his wits, Hantengu contains a power to summon powerful demons which represent his many emotions.

                                Gyokko specifically holds the position of Upper Moon Five, making him one of the more powerful demons in the series. His appearance is distinctive, with a body covered in a shell-like armor and a lantern-like structure on his head. Each member of the Twelve Kizuki is associated with a specific moon, and Gyokko's rank as Upper Moon Five signifies his strength and standing among the demons.

Gyutaro is Daki's younger brother, and he takes on the appearance of a massive demon with two heads. He is extremely protective of his sister. While Gyutaro can be ruthless in battle, he is not without a sense of loyalty and familial connection.

                                Rokuro is a minor character in Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. As a Lower Rank Two of the Twelve Demon Moons, he was presumably the second strongest of the Lower Ranks, but was still not strong enough to spare himself from Muzan Kibutsuji's wrath for being unable to match the powers of the much more formidable Upper Ranks.

                                    Out of the Lower Ranks, Wakuraba was shown to be one of the most loyal to Muzan Kibutsuji. Despite the fact that Muzan was brutally executing two of his fellow Lower Ranks, he thought only about improving himself to live up to Muzan's expectations and win back his favor. However, Wakuraba appeared to believe in self-preservation above all else and was not just blindly obedient to Muzan. He didn’t wish to be killed by him even though he clearly usually respected his leader's decisions, running away upon realizing that Muzan had no intention of letting any of the Lower Ranks be left alive.

                                 Mukago was a member of the Twelve Kizuki, having held the position of Lower Rank Four.Like most demons, Mukago held great fear and respect for Muzan Kibutsuji. However, out of all the Lower Ranks, she was also shown to be the most cowardly. As stated by Muzan through reading her thoughts, Mukago had no intention of battling the Demon Slayer Corps' Hashira and planned to flee at the mere mention of one, noted to have done so numerous times. When Muzan learned of this, Mukago attempted to deny her thoughts in an attempt to appease him.

He constantly wore a scared expression due to the fact that he felt weak and vulnerable as the lowest of the Lower Ranks. Little was known about Kamanue's strength and abilities as a demon, but it can be assumed that he was much stronger than the average demon and likely surpassed Kyogai, the former member of the Twelve Kizuki whose place he took.
